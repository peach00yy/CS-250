Interpreting user needs can be tricky, clear and consicse communication is key to fullfilling the needs properly. Creating user stories give the users a chance to list their exact thoughts and recommendations directly for the development team to read. Once recieving the user story as a developer I can take their input and apply changes where they make sense. 

Firstly, I like to write a comphrensive plan that allows me to list and address all the requirments provided. Writing a development plan provides me with a clear path towards achieving my goals. I look forward to being able to use the agile scrum method in my own work and planning. 

Being a good team member means you are able to clearly communicate what tools and assistance you need to complete your tasks as quickly and effectively as possible. You are able to work at a good pace and provide the highest quality work. You also are willing and able to provide assistance to any other member of the team when necessary. Overall being a good team member means you are a respectful and diligient person, who is willing to work hard and carry their own weight within the project team.
